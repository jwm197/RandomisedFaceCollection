For this project I was determined to make a face set with a lot of variety which I ended up with as it ended up being given it has 20 randomised parameters which can lead to a very high degree of variation. My colour scheme was inspired by the De Stijl movement which has made some coloured sections between black strokes. As my faces are very house like I styled my arrangement to look like a street.  I wanted to extend my JavaScript knowledge through the use of object-orientated programming which I feel I have been very successful in (although it was potentially overkill for a project like this). I have also learnt a lot about the p5js library and how it works thanks to digging through the code of it and how to import certain functions from it before the library is loaded in the setup function. If I had more time I would like to fiddle with the ears further to stop the eyes from overlapping with them when eyeX is large and the eye itself is large. As well as the single eye and how it can overlap with the nose when it is a Cyclops. These are rare edge cases though so it isnâ€™t a big deal and overall I am very happy with the result. 

The randomised variables are:

Note these variables maybe adjusted after generating the random values but these are the bounds at the time of generation. Also note all variables listed in the bounds are global constants unless stated to be a face's and all functions listed are in the Face class.
